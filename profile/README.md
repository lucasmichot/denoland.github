## About Deno

Deno is a simple, modern and secure runtime for JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly that uses V8 and is built in Rust.

- Provides [web platform functionality](https://deno.land/manual/runtime/web_platform_apis.md) and adopts web platform standards.
- Secure by default. No file, network, or environment access, unless explicitly enabled.
- Supports [TypeScript](https://deno.land/manual/typescript) out of the box.
- Ships only a single executable file.
- Has [built-in development tooling](https://deno.land/manual/tools) like a dependency inspector ([`deno info`](https://deno.land/manual/tools/dependency_inspector)) and a code formatter ([`deno fmt`](https://deno.land/manual/tools/formatter)).
- Has a set of reviewed (audited) standard modules that are guaranteed to work with Deno: [deno.land/std](https://doc.deno.land/https://deno.land/std).
- Has a number of [companies interested in using and exploring Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno/wiki#companies-interested-in-deno).

## Deno Deploy

[Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy) is a distributed system that runs JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly at the edge, worldwide.

The service deeply integrates the *V8 JavaScript runtime* with a high performance asynchronous web server to provide optimal performance without unnecessary intermediate abstractions.

- [Develop Locally, Deploy Globally](https://deno.com/deploy/docs): Deno Deploy is built on the same underlying infrastructure as the *Deno CLI*, allowing you to develop locally without internet access.
- [No Vendor Lock In](https://deno.com/deploy/docs): The service deeply integrates the *V8 JavaScript runtime* with a high performance asynchronous web server to provide optimal performance without unnecessary intermediate abstractions..
- [Built For Performance](https://deno.com/deploy/docs): Deno is built on the fastest server technologies available: *Rust*, *V8*, *Hyper*, and *Tokio*. Never miss a beat.
